database: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files

    See "CodeBook.md"" for a description of the variables, the data used, and the script actions to to clean up the data
    The file "run_analysis.R" containes the script to clean up the 
    data, taking the steps required in the coursera guide:
    (a) the script Merges training and test sets to create one data set.
    (b) the script extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    (c) the script uses better full-descriptive names to rename the activities in the data set
    (d) the cript improves the labels for the data set with descriptive variable names.
    (e) The script uses the data set in step (d), creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

    FinalData.txt is final tidy data.
